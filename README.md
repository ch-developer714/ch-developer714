- 👋 Hi, I’m @codyhilyard
- 👀 I’m interested in data science using Python and R. Currently, I have 2.5 years of experience in data extraction, transformation, and visualization using R. I also specialize in complex data extraction and transformation using SQL.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basics in Python. My goal is to obtain the same skills as in R so I can use R for statistical analysis and use Python for everything else.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I am currently working on a project to analyze what factors in my life affect stress. R is the primary program used to web-scrape online data that is available to the public, accept user input, clean and transform data, upload data to Google Sheets, and create visualizations. When time permits, I will create an interactive dashboard using R Shiny to present the visualizations.
