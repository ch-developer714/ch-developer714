- 👋 Hi, I’m @ch-developer714
- 👀 I’m interested in data science using R. I have 2 experience years of data extraction, transformation, and visualization. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basics in Python. My goal is to obtain the same skills as in R so I can use R for statistical analysis and use Python for, well, everything else.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I am currently working on a project to analyze what factors in my life affect stress. R is the primary program used to web-scrape online data that is available to the public, accept user input, clean and transform data, upload data to Google Sheets, and create visualizations.
